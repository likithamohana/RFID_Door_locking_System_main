Project Title: RFID Door Locking System

Description: This project involves the design and implementation of a smart door locking system using IoT technology. The system allows remote access control using RFID tags, and it integrates with cloud services for real-time monitoring and security.

Features:

Remote locking and unlocking of doors via mobile/web interface.
Access control with RFID authentication.
Integration with smart home ecosystems.
Real-time notifications for security events.
Secure communication with encryption.
Tech Stack:

Hardware: RFID module, Arduino, Solenoid lock, Relay module, Jumper wires.
Software: Arduino IDE, Embedded C, IoT cloud platform.
How It Works: The system uses RFID tags for authentication. When a valid tag is detected, the solenoid lock is triggered to open. The system is monitored and controlled remotely via IoT platforms.

Installation:

Clone the repository.
Set up the hardware components (as per the circuit diagram).
Upload the code to the Arduino using the Arduino IDE.
Usage: After setup, present an RFID tag to the reader. If the tag is authorized, the lock will open for a preset time.
